# To run TravisCI and build locally:
# 1. Download Docker
# 2. Run a docker container with a travisci/ci-python image.
# 3. Switch to the travis user using: `su - travis`
# 4. Install the wwtd(What Will Travis Do) gem.
#    it will run your project's .travis.yml for you.
#    ensure that tox, python3 and python2.7 are installed.
# 5. Run `pyenv shell 3.6 2.7` to prepare the needed venvs.
# 6. Run `wwwtd -u install -u language` to force travis to use your settings.
# 7. If your builds succeed, then you are good to go. :)
